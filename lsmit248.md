My name is Laura Smith 
I'm a junior computer science student. I am attempting to get a machine learning minor, and this class will help me get one step closer to that goal. I interned for ORNL over the summer 
and this semester I am TAing for 230 and next semester I'll return to ORNL. Outside of school I'm interesting in games (making and playing them) and art as well. I grew up in Colorado and I now live in 
Fountain City with my dog, Princess. I'm looking forward to this class because it's one of the first ML classes I'm taking towards my minor. I enjoy learning web development in my free time as well, and I
wish there were classes on it at utk.
